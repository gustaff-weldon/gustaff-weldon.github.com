00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.042
(drumbeat)

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:12.025
(plaintive violin solo playing)

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.183
(wind whistling)

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.025
(orchestra music swells)

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:43.192
(weapons clash)

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.175
(gasps)

00:00:44.183 --> 00:00:45.158
(grunts)

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:47.058
(groaning)

00:00:54.192 --> 00:00:55.150
(blade rings)

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:57.008
(bellowing)

00:00:57.017 --> 00:00:58.067
(grunting)

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.133
(panting)

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:06.125
(cries out in agony)

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.058
(panting)

(orchestra plays ominous low notes)

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:35.133
(plaintive violin solo returns)

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:49.058
This blade has a dark past.

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:54.108
It has shed much innocent blood.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.000
You're a fool for traveling alone 
 so completely unprepared. 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.033
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:06.075
Thank you.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.125
So...

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.142
What brings you to the land of the gatekeepers?

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:16.150
I'm... I'm searching for someone.

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:19.092
Someone very dear?

00:02:19.183 --> 00:02:21.008
A kindred spirit?

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.142
A dragon.

00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:27.167
(fire crackling)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.092
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.183
(birds cawing)

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.167
I've been alone for as long as I can remember.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:47.100
(flies buzzing)

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.058
(birds cawing)

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.042
(sniffs)

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.075
(hollow thump)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.017
(gasps)

00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:04.092
(whimpering)

00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:09.167
(squeaking)

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:14.133
(whimpering)

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:16.092
Shh.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.033
(sniffing)

00:03:25.017 --> 00:03:26.008
(shrieking)

00:03:26.017 --> 00:03:27.067
Shh. Hey, shh-shh.

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:29.042
We're almost done.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:31.167
Hey, sit still.

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.108
(chuckles gently)

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:49.075
Good night, Scales.

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:58.083
(gentle music playing)

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.117
(clucking)

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:11.000
SINTEL:
Get him, Scales!

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:12.075
Come on! Get him!

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.183
(clucking)

00:04:15.192 --> 00:04:17.067
(laughing softly as she runs)

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.183
Ooh!

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:25.142
Scales?

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:30.100
(chicken clucks)

00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:42.158
(flock cawing)

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:45.158
(wings fluttering)

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:49.083
(panting)

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.125
(orchestra music swells)

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.150
(laughing)

00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:03.183
Yeah!

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.175
Yeah!

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.150
Come on!

00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:10.008
Whoo!

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:15.125
(screeching)

00:05:15.142 --> 00:05:16.167
(thud)

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:22.067
(snarls)

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:27.067
(crunching)

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.100
(grunts)

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:37.117
(screeching)

00:05:38.092 --> 00:05:39.092
Scales!

00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:49.175
(wind whistling softly)

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:52.175
(breathing hard)

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.050
(lyrical oboe playing over orchestra)

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:13.050
(ethereal chorus singing)

00:06:26.092 --> 00:06:28.050
(beast growling)

00:06:30.017 --> 00:06:31.133
(cries out in pain)

00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:38.142
(wind roaring)

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.025
(groans)

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.100
(gasps)

00:06:57.058 --> 00:06:59.150
(panting and gasping)

00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:06.017
(wind whistling)

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.083
(weapons clash)

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:22.117
(panting)

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:26.183
I have failed.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.158
Mmm...

00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:34.133
You've only failed to see.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.175
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.083
You are closer than you know.

00:07:51.192 --> 00:07:55.042
(quiet music playing)

00:08:07.158 --> 00:08:11.042
(footsteps crunching softly)

00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:20.192
(growling softly)

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.008
(crunching loudly)

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.192
(meat ripping)

00:08:45.142 --> 00:08:46.158
(soft thud)

00:08:58.108 --> 00:09:01.083
(squealing)

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.083

(growling)

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.175
Scales!

00:09:30.017 --> 00:09:31.067
(bellowing)

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:33.000
(shards tinkling as they fall)

(growling)

00:10:20.183 --> 00:10:21.192
Scales?

00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:27.175
Scales...

00:10:47.142 --> 00:10:49.025
(moaning softly)

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.083
